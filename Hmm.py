#In this example, we create a simple HMM with two hidden states (state 0 and state 1) and two observable states (0 and 1). We fit the model to the observable sequence X to estimate the model's parameters, which include transition probabilities, emission probabilities, and initial state probabilities.

#The model.predict(X.reshape(-1, 1)) function predicts the most likely sequence of hidden states for the observed sequence X.

#Keep in mind that in real-world scenarios, you would typically use HMMs for tasks like sequence prediction, speech recognition, or natural language processing, where you have a sequence of observations and want to infer the underlying hidden states that generated those observations. For more complex scenarios and real-world applications, you may need to preprocess data, use more sophisticated HMM variants (e.g., GaussianHMM for continuous observations), and consider training the model on larger datasets to achieve more accurate and meaningful results.
